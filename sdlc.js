// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysis = "This is the second step, Analysing requirements is considered part of planning to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements"
const design = "This is the third step, It models the way a software application will work, Part of designs are Platforms, Security, User interfaces"
const Test  = "This is the forth step, This is the actual writing of the program. "
const Implementation = "This is the fith step, Where the program or software is actually deployed to be used"
const Maintain = "This is the Sixth step, In this phase, users discover bugs that werent found during testing. These errors need to be resolved"
